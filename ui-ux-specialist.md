As the Stash community continues to grow and evolve, there is a growing interest in refining the UI/UX of Stash and StashBox to make the experience more accessible. The goal is to guide the community toward achieving this abstract goal. Still, it is essential to note that changes require significant time and attention investments from core contributors.

To achieve this goal, the following will be taken into consideration:

* Ensuring that all changes do not regress the software or break deployments
* Avoiding creating unnecessary forks
* Ensuring that what is deployed has a smooth upgrade path that doesn't require advanced user knowledge to follow
The plan of action is as follows:
* Examining user-submitted, community-maintained CSS tweaks to the base of Stash and identifying which pieces can be merged into the main UI
* Mastering the current UI as best as possible by clarifying documentation and establishing unit testing
* Utilizing Selenium/Playwright tests in the CI/CD process to ensure that changes don't regress
* Identifying pain points in the current UI and addressing them with the least impacts and the most achievable improvements to the user experience
* If necessary, consider a new version of the whole UI, but not alienating the current user base to appeal to a theoretical one.

Whether this will become an actual role is still up in the air. However, to be considered for this role, you should be a self-driven individual who is capable and willing to be persistent in making progress on project tasks, inspiring and patient. You should also be able to work well in a team and be humble, patient, accepting, and non-judgmental.
